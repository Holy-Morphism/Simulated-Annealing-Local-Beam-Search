## Steps to Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem

1. Import the necessary libraries: numpy, matplotlib, networkx, and time.

2. Define the coordinates of the cities using the provided numpy array.

3. Define a function to calculate the distance between two cities.

4. Define a function to calculate the total distance of a path.

5. Define a function to visualize the path using networkx and matplotlib.

## Hill Climbing Algorithm

1. Start with a random solution (path).

2. Calculate the total distance of the current path.

3. Generate a new path by swapping two cities in the current path.

4. Calculate the total distance of the new path.

5. If the new path is shorter, replace the current path with the new path.

6. Repeat the process until no shorter path is found.

## Simulated Annealing Algorithm

1. Start with a random solution (path).

2. Calculate the total distance of the current path.

3. Generate a new path by swapping two cities in the current path.

4. Calculate the total distance of the new path.

5. If the new path is shorter, replace the current path with the new path.

6. If the new path is longer, replace the current path with the new path with a certain probability.

7. Repeat the process until no shorter path is found or the temperature is too low.

## Local Beam Search Algorithm

1. Start with a set of random solutions (paths).

2. Calculate the total distance of each path.

3. Generate new paths by swapping two cities in each current path.

4. Select the best paths.

5. Repeat the process until no shorter path is found.

## Running the Algorithms

1. Run each algorithm and measure the time it takes.

2. Visualize the best path found by each algorithm.
